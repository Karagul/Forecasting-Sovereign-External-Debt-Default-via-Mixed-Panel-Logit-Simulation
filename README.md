# Forecasting-Sovereign-External-Debt-Default-via-Mixed-Panel-Logit-Simulation
Data Bootcamp course Project (NYU Stern Fall 2018)

The title of the paper does justice to the project content and results. The PDF contains a full description of the project, including 
data used as well as specifics of the methodology employed to estimate the model.

# NOTE:
mixed_panel_logit.py was almost exclusively written by Kenneth Rios (https://github.com/kenrios1993). In particular, the mixed-logit model
specification and construction. My contributions were limited to helping construct the cross-validation loop.

default_data.py was also authored by Kenneth Rios, but contributions were jointly made.
